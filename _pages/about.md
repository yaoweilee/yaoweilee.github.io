I'm currently a second-year PhD student at ReLER Lab, University of Technology Sydney. My supervisors are Dr. Linchao Zhu and Prof. Yi Yang. 

My research mainly focuses on Multimodal Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Medical AI. I got my bachlor's and master's degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in 2018 and 2020, respectively.
